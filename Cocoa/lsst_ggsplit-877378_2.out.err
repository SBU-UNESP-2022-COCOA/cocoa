--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A request for multiple cpus-per-proc was given, but a directive
was also given to map to an object level that has less cpus than
requested ones:

  #cpus-per-proc:  24
  number of cpus:  12
  map-by:          BYNUMA

Please specify a mapping level that has more cpus, or else let us
define a default mapping that will allow multiple cpus-per-proc.
